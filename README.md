# Planner
Short and long term scheduler and responsibilities reminder!
This a personal project meant to test my abilites on web developing and solve a recurring problem in my life: having a place to write down appointments!
I will be using everything i have learnt on .Net and some database knowledge (mostly ADO.NET and DAPPER), i have a decent image in my head of what the "final" version
should look like but i cannot promise everything. I would be satisfied with the app being able to record short term (current and following day) and long term
(15 days and uncertain future) appointments, being able to differenciate between one time "dates" and recurring activities, keep some history and maybe, even a
calendar-looking interface aside from the regular list type of view.
Wish me luck!
